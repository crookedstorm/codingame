# A Scratch and Store Repo For Codingame Puzzles

I'm keeping my puzzle solutions used for the https://codingame.com website in this repo for reference and history.  I think it might be interesting to see what I think is a good solution now 2 years from now.

If you use them to cheat, I hope you learn something in the process or at very least improve on mine a little.  If you have good ideas to share with me, I'm all ears as well!
